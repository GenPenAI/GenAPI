`100 Days of Generated REST APIs`

## Welcome to the GenPen 100 Days of Generated REST APIs Repo

In this repo you will find folders that contain, you guessed it, generated RESTful APIs!
We'll be posting all of these to twitter as we continue our challenge. 

Welcome to the 100 Day Challenge on Generating REST APIs with AI! This challenge is designed to help you learn and practice the art of using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate RESTful APIs. By dedicating 100 days to this challenge, we will gain valuable insights and hands-on experience in leveraging AI technologies to automate the process of building APIs.

## Abstract

In this challenge, we will explore how AI can streamline and enhance the development of RESTful APIs. Traditional API development involves manual coding, data modeling, and handling various HTTP methods. With AI-powered techniques, we can automate parts of the API generation process, enabling developers to save time, reduce errors, and improve productivity.

Throughout the challenge, we will cover topics such as:

- Understanding the basics of RESTful API design
- Exploring AI technologies for generating APIs
- Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) to extract API specifications
- Utilizing machine learning algorithms to automate API development
- Evaluating and refining the generated APIs
- Integrating AI-generated APIs into real-world applications
